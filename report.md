# What is a Disruptive technology?
A disruptive technology has the potential to undermine an existing market, system, or product. Investing in this technology may provide risk of selling immediately or sometimes not at all to the public (Smith, 2020). However, missing the speed of innovation often leads companies to be left behind.

# What is Digital Fashion?
Digital Fashion is not only a sustainable alternative method to clothing, but it is also an innovative technology that brings new meaning to fashion, luxury, and entertainment. 

The fashion industry comprises fashion enthusiasts, influencers, and consumers. As they set the ‘trend’ for clothes, accessories, footwear, etc., so do the rise of harmful effects on the environment. According to Beall (2020), the fashion industry accounts for 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Digital Fashion, on the other hand, promotes sustainability. Their unique feature is enabling users to 3D edit digital clothes on themselves. (Digital Clothing: All You Need to Know About the Future of Fashion Brands, n.d.). Currently, it is a trend in the fashion industry, prevalent in the age of Instagram of online photos and OOTDs shared worldwide.

As we all know, clothing is one of a person's basic needs to live. However, as time evolved, clothing went beyond the realm of necessity, and into luxury, fashion, and entertainment. It is wise that as we use evolve clothing into a natural extension of self-identity, and in high-end fashion, we use sustainable methods that protect our environment, not harm it further. 

# Why is it considered a disruptive technology?
Digital Fashion can be disruptive to the fast fashion industry, it provides a platform for people to enjoy the experience of expressing oneself with fashion without having to consume or produce textile. The gaming industry has already proven that this is a successful market. Gaming companies such as Sims, League of Legends, Grand Theft Auto and more capitalize custom outfits for characters. Other than buying the game itself, skins (along with weapon upgrades) have been one of the main money producing tactics for these companies.

Moreover, in our new normal with the pandemic, digital fashion just fits right in. Recent fashion events have been conducted online because of quarantine protocols. Digital fashion now introduces a new world for virtual-catwalks, photoshots, and exhibits. People also are rarely able to show off their outfits outside, so digital fashion offers safely parading your OOTD at home. Lastly, as this technology does not produce textile, when publicized it could be an affordable way to replace fast fashion. Fast fashion according to Hayes (2021), is the bottom of the fashion hierarchy; it is cheap, trendy, and changes out quickly. They are the biggest contributors to pollution to our waters as speed manufacturing requires toxic cheap dye and mass produced textiles also mostly end up in landfills (The Problem with Fast Fashion, 2019).
