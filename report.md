# What is a Disruptive technology?

Clothing is considered one of the human's basic needs to live. But as time evolves, our view for clothing changed from it being a necessity into becoming a luxury to have. Clothes became a natural extension of ourselves. It helps us express who we are, our interests, and sometimes our status in life. Clothes became our entertainment.
The fashion industry is composed of enthusiasts, influencers, and consumers of what we essentially wear. They are the ones who are responsible for setting the "trend" in clothes, accessories, footwear, etc. The fashion industry is also the one to account for the 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide (Beall, 2020).
