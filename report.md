# What is Digital Fashion?
Clothing is one of the many basic things a human needs to live comfortably. However, as time evolved, clothing has gone beyond the realm of necessity and into the realms of luxury, fashion, and entertainment. Clothing became a natural extension of one's identity -- helping us express who we are, display our interests, and oftentimes our social status. 

It's worth mentioning that the reason why clothing has become something more than a mere necessity is all thanks to the fashion industry, comprised of fashion enthusiasts, influencers, and consumers. However, as these influencers set trends for clothes, accessories, footwear, etc. that come and go, the rise of harmful effects the fashion industry has on the environment subsequently becomes more evident. According to Beall (2020), the fashion industry accounts for 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. 

Digital fashion, on the other hand, promotes sustainability. This is because main selling point of digital fashion is that it enables users to 'wear' clothes by editing the digital pieces onto themselves as if they actually bought the item in person (Digital Clothing: All You Need to Know About the Future of Fashion Brands, n.d.). Currently, digital fashion is a growing trend in the fashion industry, prevalent in the age of Instagram where OOTDs (outfit of the day) are shared worldwide.

Digital fashion is also beneficial for brand designers. According to Replicant (n.d.), “digital clothes, digital garments are constructed based on real templates and using professional 3D-applications for tailors. Hence virtual clothes can be produced in reality. And brands and designers can present their new works digitally, collect pre-orders, produce limited capsules.” Thus, digital fashion allows designers to push the limits of their artistic expression and create designs that would otherwise be impossible if it were a physical piece of clothing. 

# Why is it considered a disruptive technology?

First, what is a disruptive technology? Technology is considered as disruptive when it has the potential to undermine an existing market, system, or product. According to Smith (2020), investing in this type of technology may provide risk of selling immediately or sometimes not at all to the public. However, missing the speed of innovation often leads companies to be left behind.

So how is digital fashion disruptive? For one, it can be disruptive to the fashion industy because it provides a platform for consumers to enjoy the experience of expressing oneself through fashion without actually having to consume or produce textile. The gaming industry as well has already proven that this is a successful market. Gaming companies such as Sims, League of Legends, Grand Theft Auto and more capitalize on creating custom outfits for their characters. Other than buying the game itself, skins (along with weapon upgrades) have been one of the main money producing tactics for these companies.

Digital also aligns with the restrictions during this pandemic. Digital fashion now introduces a new world for virtual-catwalks, photoshots, and exhibits. People also are rarely able to show off their outfits outside, so digital fashion offers safely parading your OOTD (outfit of the day) at home. It also serves as an innovative technology that brings new meaning to the fashion, luxury, and entertainment industry as a whole. As this technology does not produce textile, when publicized, it could be an affordable way to replace fast fashion. Fast fashion according to Hayes (2021), is the bottom of the fashion hierarchy; it is cheap, trendy, and changes out quickly. They are the biggest contributors to pollution to our waters as speed manufacturing requires toxic cheap dye and mass produced textiles also mostly end up in landfills (Battered Women's Support Services, 2019).
